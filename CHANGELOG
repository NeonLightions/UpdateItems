# UpdateItems Plugin Changelog

## [1.1-SNAPSHOT] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- Support for updating items for **offline players** by modifying their MMOItems `PlayerData.yml` files.
- Added aliases for the `/update` command: `updateitems`, `ui`.

### Changed
- Switched to using `MMOItemUtils.getNBT()` instead of accessing `MythicLib.plugin.getNBTItem()` directly.
- Improved command registration to prevent `NullPointerException` on plugin startup.
- Updated command executor logic to handle missing items and players more gracefully.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where offline players were skipped entirely.
- Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of MythicLib and MMOItems.

### Removed
- Deprecated direct use of `SmartGive`; now relies on MMOItems' internal item handling utilities.
